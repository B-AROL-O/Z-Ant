IR_zant
- for each ZantNode:
    - getInputs()
    - getOutputs()
    - once done above complete write_op_info()
- implement mean node( first check Merge MirkoGraphZant -> GraphZant )
- implement slice node( first check Merge MirkoGraphZant -> GraphZant )
- implement squeeze node( first check Merge MirkoGraphZant -> GraphZant )

IR_CODEGEN
- dynamicAllocation
- when running :  `zig build IR_codegen -Dlog` and `zig build test-generated-lib` you obtain
    [test_model] (info):
    User tests are disabled for this model
  It is related to the import of "codegen" inside *** GENERATED LIBRARY TESTS *** in build.zig

- check that the passed that the parameters passed to IR_codegen.generate_from_*() are correct, string format, no wite spaces,
  generated_path ending with "/", ecc...
- aggregate build steps where possible, too many . Write documentation about it, describin what does each build command
- error on Split op when launching "zig build test-codegen-gen -Dlog", now Split is excluded from "available_operations"

  thread 26012 panic: reached unreachable code
  /home/mirko/Documents/zig/zig-linux-x86_64-0.14.0/lib/std/posix.zig:1267:23: 0x109187e in write (oneop_codegen)
              .FAULT => unreachable,

- codegenerating "T" as the input type of the lean math op is not possible anymore
- use TensorZant.getNameSanitized() and not utils.getSanitizedName()
- remove "const utils = @import("codegen").utils;" from all op_*.zig and fix, 
- do not codegenerate "const codegen = @import("codegen");" and use instead "const codegen = @import("codegen");" and fix by conseguence

OTHER :
- check missing op between: python generator, available_operations.txt, IR_graph operators
- implement dynamic free in predict()
- Gathers leaks
- Gelu loops when called "zig build test-codegen"
- add comments on available_operation.txt, something like ?op_name is ignored
